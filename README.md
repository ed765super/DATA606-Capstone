# DATA606-Capstone

The Baltimore Police Agency launched a massive overhaul to its new Records Management Systems back in May 2020. The improvement will enable the department to migrate from a paper-based system to a completely digital reporting environment. As a consequence of this major shift, we had significant difficulties in appropriately transferring data from the new records system to the previous Open Data Baltimore system. The "Arrests" dataset is one of many open datasets made publicly accessible by Baltimore's police department on the city's Open Data website. This information is provided to us in order to foster more openness and data exchange between the local administration and its residents. This dataset contains arrest records for offenses such as assault, theft, and property damage in the City of Baltimore. [1]

I want to use their database create a model that predicts which district a crime occurs based on various details related to the arrest of the perpetrator such as what he or she was charged with, their gender, etc. My hope with this model is that the department can then use this model to efficiently spread their resources tackling the more likely arrests that would be made in a certain district as well as modify their policing efforts to decrease bias in said policing efforts in certain districts (if any).
